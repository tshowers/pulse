/**
 * Lands here when a native TODD app (via TODDAuthKit's WebHandoff) hands
 * off to a page on this app, already signed in - the "Real Token Handoff"
 * feature. Unlike AuthCallbackComponent (which completes this app's own
 * hosted-login redirect to todd.taliferro.tech/login and checks a
 * pre-stashed `state` value as a CSRF guard against a forged callback), a
 * native app opens this URL directly with no prior visit to this origin,
 * so there's no pending sessionStorage entry to check the token against -
 * the short-lived, single-exchange custom token itself is the credential,
 * minted server-side (`POST /api/mobile/auth/web-handoff-token`,
 * `mobileAuthRoutes.js` in the main taliferrotech repo) only for an
 * already-authenticated native-app caller. Mirrors web-products/outreach's,
 * web-products/docs' and web-products/network's own
 * `mobile-handoff.component.ts` - same pattern, ported here since this app
 * is deployed and routed separately. Without this route, an unmatched
 * `/mobile-handoff` request fell through to this app's `**` catch-all and
 * showed NotFoundComponent instead of signing in.
