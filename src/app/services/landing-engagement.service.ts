 * exit-intent/CTA-click signals to TODD's assistant bus so the assistant
 * can react to visitor engagement - since this app deliberately doesn't
 * carry the full assistant bus, there's nothing for these signals to feed.
 * Kept as a same-shaped no-op rather than deleted so the landing
 * component's structure - and the option to wire real analytics here
 * later - stays intact.
